# Find the Max

---

## Requirements
- Create a function that takes in four numbers and finds the highest of the four
- The finding of the max should be implemented in it's own function and the numbers should be passed in
- There are functions that do this for you, but you must write the logic to find the max yourself

## Sample Input / Output
```
#> 1 2 3 4
4

#> 4 3 2 1
4

#> 2 3 1 0
3
```

---

## Advanced Work
### Using the command line
Write this in such a way that you can pass the numbers directly in on the command line.

### Multiple Items
Modify your function so that it can work on any size list of numbers.
