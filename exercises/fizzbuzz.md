# FizzBuzz

---

## Requirements
- Create a simple program that counts from 1 to 100.
- For any output that is a divisible by 3, instead of “Fizz”.
- For any output that is divisible by 5, instead output “Buzz”.
- For any output that is divisible by 3 and 5, output both “Fizz" and "Buzz”.

## Sample Output
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```

## Advanced Work
### User Input
Modify the program to take in user input to specify the number to stop counting to.

### User Customization
Make further modifications to the program to allow the user to specify when to print “Fizz” and “Buzz” (“FizzBuzz” should still be based on the the numbers for “Fizz” and “Buzz”!)
